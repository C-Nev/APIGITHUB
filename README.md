# APIGITHUB

## Project:
To create a piece of software that interogates the Github API and visualised 
the data in order to give the user insight into the software development process.
        
## Approach:
To use the python requests library to interogate the API and use libraries
like matplotlib to visualise the data. Hopefully aiming to host the project
on a web app using an application like Django.
